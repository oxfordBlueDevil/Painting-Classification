    <h2>About <i> neuralArt.io </i> </h2>
    <p id="instructions"><b> The objective of classifying fine art paintings is highly complex. When studying a painting, an art expert can figure out its style, its genre, the artist, and the period to which it belongs. </b></p>
    <p id="instructions"><b> At first thought, it is almost laughable to think that a machine can be able to classify paintings. And yet, <i> neuralArt.io </i> seeks to exactly do that.</b></p>
    <p id="instructions"><b> Since the field of computer vision has made signficant leaps in getting digital systems to recognize and categorize objects and scenes in images and videos, today it's possible to make machines learn and judge such complex visual concepts and stylistic elements. The ultimate goal of <i>neuralArt.io </i> is to develop a Machine Learning model that is able to perform large-scale fine art painting classification and be capable to make semantic-level judgements, such as predicting a painting's genre (portrait or landscape) and its artist. </b></p>
    <p id="instructions"><b> At the moment, using deep neural networks, our artist classifier can detect paintings of Van Gogh, Joseph Mallord Turner, and Cezanne, and our genre classifier can detect whether or not a painting is a portrait. Please find a painting of your own and test out our neural network classifiers on this app. </b></p>

<!--         <p id="instructions"><b>While it&#39s certainly possible to search restaurant review sites for places serving a certain cuisine at a certain price point with a certain rating, it&#39s more difficult to capture some of the more subtle aspects of what makes an establishment special.</b></p>
        <p id="instructions"><b>Some restaurants have amazing waterfront views, while others offer views of a skyline. &nbsp Some pizza is Chicago style, some pizza is New York style, and sometimes pizza connoisseurs want something more artisanal. &nbsp Cozy?&nbsp  Romantic? &nbsp Loud? &nbsp Fun?&nbsp  Tast.io is able to tease out these qualities from what people are saying on Yelp.&nbsp If you would like to find out more about how it works, please visit <a href="https://github.com/KenDooley/Tast.io/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">my github link</a>.</b></p>
        <p id="instructions"><b>At the moment, only restaurants in New York City and San Francisco are supported.</b></p> -->
